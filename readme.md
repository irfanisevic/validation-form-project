## Introduction

This project is intended to give me an opportunity to apply new web development concepts I've learned, such as form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main focus is on creating a user-friendly sign-up form that provides feedback based on input validation.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout:** Although responsive design was not the primary focus, the layout adapts decently to various screen sizes.
- **Form Validation:**
  - Input fields for username, email, and password.
  - Passwords must match and are validated for proper format using pseudo-classes like `:invalid` and `:focus`.
- **Custom Styling:** Styled form elements and buttons, with some visual effects on hover and focus.
- **External Fonts:** An external font was used for the logo, giving the project a professional look.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the form structure and content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the form, including background images, buttons, and input fields.
- **JavaScript**: For handling client-side form validation (not yet implemented but planned in future lessons).

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/irfanisevic/validation-form-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd validation-form-project
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the sign-up form.

4. Optionally, you can install a live server extension in your code editor to view the project dynamically.

## Usage

1. Users can input their details in the form fields:
   - Username
   - Email
   - Password and Confirm Password
2. The form provides feedback if the passwords do not match or other fields contain invalid data.
3. A background image and an external logo enhance the visual appeal of the form.
